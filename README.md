# Avocado-Price-Regression

Avocado Price Regression Project
Overview
This project aims to predict avocado prices using regression techniques. We analyze historical data on avocado prices, weather conditions, and other relevant features to build a predictive model.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

Date: Date of observation
AveragePrice: Average price of avocados
Total Volume: Total volume of avocados sold
…
Libraries and Packages
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas: Data manipulation
numpy: Numerical operations
matplotlib: Data visualization
seaborn: Enhanced data visualization
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
…
Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset.
Handle missing values (impute or drop).
Convert categorical variables to numerical (one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Split data into training and testing sets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize avocado price trends over time.
Explore correlations between features.
Investigate seasonality effects.
Feature Engineering
Create new features (e.g., rolling averages, lag variables).
Normalize or scale numerical features.
Model Selection
Choose regression models (linear regression, decision tree, etc.).
Train and evaluate models using cross-validation.
Select the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using metrics (RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
Visualize predicted vs. actual prices.
Conclusion
Summarize findings, limitations, and potential areas for improvement.
